            <h2><u>Early Life and Early Career Overview</u></h2>
            <p>Bryant was born in Philadelphia, as the youngest of three children and the only son of former NBA player Joe Bryant and Pamela Cox Bryant. He is also the maternal nephew of basketball player John "Chubby" Cox. His parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe, Japan, which they saw on a restaurant menu. His middle name, Bean, is derived from his father's nickname "Jellybean". Bryant was raised Roman Catholic. When Bryant was six, his father left the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball. Bryant became accustomed to his new lifestyle and learned to speak fluent Italian. During summers, he would come back to the United States to play in a basketball summer league.</p>

            <p>The son of former NBA player Joe Bryant, Kobe Bryant enjoyed a successful high school basketball career at Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania, where he was recognized as the top high school basketball player in the country. He declared for the NBA draft upon graduation, and was selected with the 13th overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets, who traded him to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned himself a reputation as a high-flyer and a fan favorite by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, and he was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite a feud between them, Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal led the Lakers to three consecutive championships from 2000 to 2002.</p>

            <h2><u>Leading the Lakers without Shaq</u></h2>
            <p>In 2003, Bryant was accused of sexual assault in Colorado, but the charges were eventually dropped, and a civil suit was settled out of court. After the Lakers lost the 2004 NBA Finals, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat. Bryant became the cornerstone of the Lakers, and he led the NBA in scoring during the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. In 2006, he scored a career-high 81 points against the Toronto Raptors, the second most points scored in a single game in league history behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. Bryant was awarded the regular season's Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) in 2008. After losing in the 2008 NBA Finals, he led the Lakers to two consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010, earning the Finals MVP Award on both occasions.

            <p> He continued to be among the top players in the league through 2013, when the 34-year-old Bryant suffered a torn Achilles tendon. Although he recovered, his play was limited the following two years by season-ending injuries to his knee and shoulder, respectively. Citing his physical decline, he announced that he would be retiring after the 2015–16 season.</p>

            <p>Bryant requested that opposing teams on the road not hold any on-court ceremonies in his honor or present him any gifts in public. Prior to announcing his retirement, he had been steadfast about not wanting the fuss of a staged farewell tour, preferring to hear boos instead of cheers. Still, he was honored around the league with video tributes, and fans greeted him with ovations, even at arenas that historically jeered him like TD Garden in Boston and Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento. Previously, Bryant was respected but not beloved, and he was astonished at the cheers he was now receiving.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Dear Basketball,</p>
              <br>
              <p>
                From the moment
                <br>
                I started rolling my dad’s tube socks
                <br>
                And shooting imaginary
                <br>
                Game-winning shots
                <br>
                In the Great Western Forum
                <br>
                I knew one thing was real:
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>I fell in love with you.</p>
              <br>
              <p>
                A love so deep I gave you my all —
                <br>
                From my mind & body
                <br>
                To my spirit & soul.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                As a six-year-old boy
                <br>
                Deeply in love with you
                <br>
                I never saw the end of the tunnel.
                <br>
                I only saw myself
                <br>
                Running out of one.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                And so I ran.
                <br>
                I ran up and down every court
                <br>
                After every loose ball for you.
                <br>
                You asked for my hustle
                <br>
                I gave you my heart
                <br>
                Because it came with so much more.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                I played through the sweat and hurt
                <br>
                Not because challenge called me
                <br>
                But because YOU called me.
                <br>
                I did everything for YOU
                <br>
                Because that’s what you do
                <br>
                When someone makes you feel as
                <br>
                Alive as you’ve made me feel.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker dream
                <br>
                And I’ll always love you for it.
                <br>
                But I can’t love you obsessively for much longer.
                <br>
                This season is all I have left to give.
                <br>
                My heart can take the pounding
                <br>
                My mind can handle the grind
                <br>
                But my body knows it’s time to say goodbye.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                And that’s OK.
                <br>
                I’m ready to let you go.
                <br>
                I want you to know now
                <br>
                So we both can savor every moment we have left together.
                <br>
                The good and the bad.
                <br>
                We have given each other
                <br>
                All that we have.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                And we both know, no matter what I do next
                <br>
                I’ll always be that kid
